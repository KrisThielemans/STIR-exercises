To be able to run these exercises you need to 
- build STIR with its Python interface (via SWIG) enabled. 
- install STIR in your preferred location
- have the STIR utilities in your PATH
- add the STIR Python library to your PYTHONPATH

On Linux/MacOS using sh/bash, the last 2 items would 
correspond to something like

PATH=/wherever/you/installed/STIR/bin:$PATH
PYTHONPATH=/wherever/you/installed/STIR/python:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH

We recommend that you run the exercises from in an interactive Python
IDE such as spyder, so you will need to install that.

An easy way to run the exercises is to use the STIR Virtual Machine, but
you can install all of this yourself of course.

The current Python scripts assume that the exercises are installed
in a sub-directory STIR-exercises of your home directory.
However, this location is only used at the
start of each script to go to the relevant directory. As long as 
you change that initial line, you should be able to install
the exercises anywhere you like.
